        The first, is that different rule types expect different kinds of data,
        but the subject (e.g. cell, row, column) cannot anticipate what data
        will be needed by each rule. By including a prepare method, and calling
        it to process the data into the evaluator, we can allow multiple types
        of rules which expect different types of data objects to co-exist.

        The second, is that we can perform undifferentiated heavy lifting that
        might be cumbersome in the evaluator method, instead of repeating
        fragments of code multiple times in the evaluator.
